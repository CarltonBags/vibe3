# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and how to fix them.

## üî¥ Authentication Errors

### Error: "Failed to fetch" when signing up/in

**What you see:**
- Yellow warning in auth modal: "‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication Not Configured"
- Buttons say "Auth Not Configured"
- Console shows "Failed to fetch"

**Why it happens:**
Supabase environment variables are missing from `.env.local`

**How to fix:**
1. Create or edit `.env.local` in project root
2. Add these three variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your-service-role-key
```
3. Get keys from Supabase dashboard: **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. **Restart dev server**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev`
5. Try signing up again ‚úÖ

**Note:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for client-side variables!

### Error: "Authentication is not configured"

**What you see:**
- Red error message in auth modal
- Clear message pointing to `.env.local`

**How to fix:**
Same as above - add Supabase credentials to `.env.local`

---

### Error: "Invalid login credentials"

**What you see:**
- Can't sign in with correct email/password
- Error appears in auth modal

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong email or password (Supabase is case-sensitive)
2. Account doesn't exist yet (need to sign up first)
3. Email not confirmed (if email confirmation is enabled)

**How to fix:**
- Double-check email and password
- Try "Sign up" if you haven't created account
- Check spam folder for confirmation email
- Check Supabase dashboard: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** to see if account exists

## üî¥ Generation Errors

### Error: "Unauthorized - Please sign in"

**What you see:**
- Can't generate websites
- Error message after submitting prompt

**Why it happens:**
Generation requires authentication (after Supabase is configured)

**How to fix:**
1. Click "Sign In" button (top right)
2. Create account or log in
3. Try generating again ‚úÖ

---

### Error: "Generation limit exceeded"

**What you see:**
- Message: "Generation limit exceeded for this month"
- Shows remaining generations: 0
- Suggests upgrade

**Why it happens:**
You've used all your monthly generations for your tier:
- Free: 3 per month
- Starter: 40 per month
- Pro: 200 per month

**How to fix:**
- Wait until next month (usage resets)
- Upgrade to higher tier
- Or continue testing without auth (see Development Mode below)

---

### Error: "Failed to create sandbox"

**What you see:**
- Generation starts but fails
- Error in progress indicators

**Possible causes:**
1. Invalid Daytona credentials
2. Daytona quota exceeded
3. Network issues
4. Daytona service down

**How to fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has correct `DAYTONA_KEY` and `DAYTONA_URL`
2. Check Daytona dashboard for quota/limits
3. Check console for specific error
4. Try again in a few minutes
5. Contact Daytona support if persistent

---

### Error: "OpenAI API error"

**What you see:**
- Generation fails during "Generating code" step
- Error mentions OpenAI

**Possible causes:**
1. Invalid OpenAI API key
2. No credits in OpenAI account
3. Rate limit exceeded
4. API key expired

**How to fix:**
1. Check `OPENAI_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Go to [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
3. Add payment method and credits
4. Check [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) for rate limits
5. Generate a new API key if needed

## üî¥ Display Issues

### Preview shows blank/white screen

**Possible causes:**
1. Sandbox not ready yet (still installing)
2. Build errors in generated code
3. WebSocket connection failed

**How to fix:**
1. Wait 60-90 seconds for full setup
2. Click "Refresh" button in preview
3. Check "Code" tab for errors
4. Try generating again with different prompt

---

### Preview shows "Warning" page

**Why it happens:**
Daytona preview URL redirects or shows warning

**How to fix:**
- Use the preview in our app (it handles warnings)
- Or click "Open in New Tab" for direct access
- Our proxy automatically bypasses warnings

---

### Code tab shows "File not found"

**Why it happens:**
File wasn't generated or didn't save

**How to fix:**
1. Check if other files appear in file tree
2. Try selecting different file
3. Generate again if all files missing
4. Check console for save errors

---

## üî¥ Development Issues

### Error: "Module not found"

**What you see:**
- Import errors in console
- App won't start

**How to fix:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

---

### Error: "Port 3000 already in use"

**What you see:**
- Can't start dev server
- Error about port in use

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

---

### Changes not appearing

**What you see:**
- Edit code but no changes show
- Old version still running

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## üü° Development Mode (No Auth)

Want to test without setting up Supabase?

### How to run without auth:

1. **Don't add** Supabase variables to `.env.local`
2. Only add OpenAI and Daytona keys
3. Start app: `npm run dev`
4. You'll see console warning (that's OK!)
5. Generate without signing in

**What works:**
- ‚úÖ UI and styling
- ‚úÖ Text input
- ‚úÖ Generation (bypasses auth check)
- ‚úÖ Preview and code viewer

**What doesn't work:**
- ‚ùå Sign up/login (buttons disabled)
- ‚ùå User menu
- ‚ùå Usage tracking
- ‚ùå Project saving
- ‚ùå Limit enforcement

**When to use:**
- Testing UI changes
- Demoing the app
- Developing without database
- Before Supabase setup complete

---

## üî¥ Database Issues

### Error: "User not found" after signup

**Why it happens:**
Database trigger not working or migration not run

**How to fix:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Re-run `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
4. Check **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** to see if user exists
5. Manually create user profile if needed

---

### Error: "Permission denied" on database query

**Why it happens:**
Row Level Security blocking query

**How to fix:**
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check RLS policies in Supabase
- Use `supabaseAdmin` for server-side queries (not `supabase`)
- Check user has correct permissions

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always restart dev server** after changing `.env.local`
2. **Check console first** - errors usually explain the issue
3. **Clear cache** if things seem stuck: `rm -rf .next`
4. **Test incrementally** - set up one thing at a time
5. **Use development mode** to test without auth
6. **Read error messages** - they're usually helpful!
